# MAUI Boggle App
An app to try out Microsoft's new MAUI development platform, adapted from the code for the 
[Upgrade your app with MVVM concepts](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/tutorials/notes-mvvm/) 
tutorial, which added MVVM to a MAUI note taking tutorial.

One can choose from a collection of 4x4, 5x5 and 6x6 Boggle games sold in real life, each featuring 
the collection of dice included with the game. The selected Boggle board can then be loaded with each 
die randomly located and oriented, or letters can be added to the board manually. The board can then 
be solved, using words from the Collins Scrabble Words dictionary, downloaded from 
http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~o-laughl/csw15.txt. Solutions are ordered by length. A solution can be 
selected to show its location on the board.

See the About page for a list of issues.
